# CIS500 Projects
In each of the folders in this repository are projects completed while in GVSU's CIS500 program. The course is largely dedicated to projects meant to demonstrate fundamental OOP principles like

The project 1 folder has a couple of the small classes Card and CardDeck. Not a whole lot going on. Has some neat methods like "shuffle" which randomizes the order of the arrayList of Card objects. Introduces the idea of Encapsulation.

The project 2 folder has a SimpleDate class, which represents some Calendar functionality with methods like dateFrom(), advance(), and daysBetween; except, construction of SimpleDate object must be for any year from 1753 to whenever, but not any year before 1753. 

The project 3 folder has several classes with only five classes, which have my work: Bank, BankAccount, CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, and BankCLI; the rest were entirely done by Professor Nandigam. Introduces the idea of Inheritance. The BankCLI class provides a prompt to add customers or accounts, withdraw, deposit, or transfer from or between accounts of a prompted customer.

Projects 4 and 5 upcoming.
