# CIS500 Projects
In each of the folders in this repository are projects completed while in GVSU's CIS500 program.

The project 1 folder has a couple of the small classes Card and CardDeck. Not a whole lot going on. Has some neat methods like "shuffle" which randomizes the order of the arrayList of Card objects.

The project 2 folder has a SimpleDate class, which represents some Calendar functionality with methods like dateFrom(), advance(), and daysBetween; except, it's built for any year from 1753, but not before. 

The project 3 folder has several classes with only five classes, which have my work: Bank, BankAccount, CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, and BankCLI; the rest were entirely done by Professor Nandigam. 

Projects 4 and 5 upcoming.
